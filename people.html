            <p>Narseo Vallina is a post doc researcher at ICSI working on Netalyzr project since July 2013 with Nick Weaver and Christian Kreibich. He defended his PhD thesis at the University of Cambridge under the supervision of Professor Jon Crowcroft in June 2013. His PhD work is the result of fruitful collaborations with Dina Papagiannaki and Yan Grunenberger from Telefonica Research (Barcelona) and Pan Hui from T-labs (Berlin). His thesis looked at cross-layer inefficiencies of mobile applications, advertisement modules, location sensors and operating systems when accessing cellular networks. In 2012, he was awarded with a Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship. His current research is mainly focused on mobile systems optimizations, network performance, cellular networks, privacy and network security.

            <p> Andrius Aucinas is a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, working with Professor Jon Crowcroft since October 2011. His PhD work started from a collaboration with T-Labs Berlin during his undergraduate years and recently has bnefited from collaboration with Dina Papagiannaki and Yan Grunenberger from Telefonica Research Barcelona. His main focus is efficient split of application functionality between a mobile device and remote services to reduce device energy waste and network signaling. Recently the main vehicle for the work has been the FirefoxOS and JavaScript.

              I was born in the little wineyard city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahors">Cahors</a> in 1980. Surrounded by computers and cables, I decided to follow an Engineering school program (<a href="http://www.ensimag.fr/">ENSIMAG</a>/Telecom, Grenoble, 2004) and then a PhD program in 2008 in the <a href="http://drakkar.imag.fr/">Drakkar</a> group of the <a href="http://www.lig-lab.fr/">LIG</a> laboratory, where I worked mainly on IEEE802.11 access methods and virtualization. After this, I joined a startup company, <a href="http://www.mootwin.com/">Mootwin</a>, to work on push-driven mobile applications, mainly on iPhone platform. I've come back to research in 2010, working in the <a href="http://www.cttc.es/">CTTC</a> Telecommunication center on Software Defined Radio platform and Wireless Sensors networks. Since july 2011, I work in Telefonica I+D.
