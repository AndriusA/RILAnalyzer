        <h3>Welcome to RILAnalyzer Page.</h3>

<p>The popularity of smartphones, cloud computing, and the app store model have led to cellular networks being used in a completely different way than what they were designed for. As a consequence, mobile applications impose new challenges in the design and efficient configuration of constrained networks to maximize applicationâ€™s performance. Such difficulties are largely caused by the lack of cross-layer understanding of interactions between different entities - applications, devices, the network and its management plane.</p>

<p>We are releasing RILAnalyzer publicly. It is a tool that provides mechanisms to perform network analysis from within a mobile device. RILAnalyzer is capable of recording low-level radio information and accurate cellular network control-plane data, as well as user-plane data. We demon- strate how such data can be used to identify previously overlooked issues. Through a small user study across four cellular network providers in two European countries we infer how different network configurations are in reality and explore how such configurations interact with application logic, causing network and energy overheads.</p>

<p>We are planning to release full source codes soon.</p>

<h3>What's the point?</h3>

<p>The point is obtaining ground-truth about network configuration and its effects on the devices.</p>

<p>Research community has been exploring the relationship between radio network management and device energy consumption for a while, but it is very hard to propose working solutions in the general case:</p>

<p>RILAnalyzer helps to infer the main network parameters to understand such inefficiencies.</p>
